<center><h1>The Code of the Game</h1></center>
<center><p>Coding this game was fairly simple, but it gives you a great foundation for new games in the future!</p></center>
<center><h3>First there is the home layout code:</h3></center>
    <center><img src="../media/homecode.png"></center>
    <center><h5>What does this mean?</h5></center>
    <center><p>When the player opens up the game they are brought to the homelayout page. If they press the play button they are then taken to the gamelayout page where they can play my game. <br> If they press the play more games button then they are brought to coolmathgames through a link that I implemented into the button!</p></center>
<center><h3>Then there is the game code:</h3></center>
    <center><img src="../media/gamecode1.png"></center>
    <center><h5>Huh?</h5></center>
    <center><p>It really is not that bad! Basically when the game starts, the animation of different colors is stopped so that your background only has one color at a time. The game hud(which we will talk about more later) is set to the opacity of zero so that you can not see it. The players score is set to zero and the player itself is set to the number value of 1, which means that the player starts alive. Every tick in the system the players socre gets updated and is shown live while the player is playing the game. Not only that, but in this code it is also made so that while the player is alive spikes are created, but once the player has died the spikes no longer get created.</p></center>
    <center><img src="../media/gamecode2.png"></center>
    <center><p>This codes makes it so that every second, at a random place along the top of the screen, a spike is created. And to avoid them coming down as a clump, the spikes are created .5 second apart! The spike speed is set as a variable(spikespeed) so that the speed of the spikes coming down is consistent throughout the game. Not only that, but every .5 seocnds the player is alive a point gets added to their score. But once the player dies, everything stops and the spikes and player destroy. Then the game waits 1.5 seconds before the Game HUd(which holds the game over title, play again button and the home button), shows up. </p></center>
    <center><img src="../media/gamecode3.png"></center>
    <center><p>If the player presses the play again button, the game restarts and the player can play the game again from scratch. If the player presses the home button then the player is sent to the home layout.</p></center>
