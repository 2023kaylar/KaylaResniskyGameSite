<center><p>This game is fairly easy. After pressing the play button the player is brought to the gameplay screen and the game starts. All the player has to do is:</p></center>
<ul>
<li>Drag the player along the screen by pressing the keypad</li> 
<li>Avoid spikes at all costs</li>
<li>Don't die</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>    
</ul>
    <center><p>Not only that but you also have a score! The longer you last the higher your score gets, so avoid the spikes for a long time to get a good score! And with some fun music in the background this game is defintiely great for passing some time!</p></center>
    <center><h1>What happens if I lose?</h1></center>
